Today marks my first day to work as a SOC analyst. Perhaps one thing I have learned over the years is to be persistent, never stop grinding and chasing down your dream. Here is my timeline for me to achieve my dream. This journey never means to be easy but I love it and had so much fun seeing myself grow over the years. I have met so many amazing people in the community and I learned so much from each one of you. Thank you Cybersecurity community.
