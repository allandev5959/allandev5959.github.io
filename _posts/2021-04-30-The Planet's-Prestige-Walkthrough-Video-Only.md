## Scenario

***CoCanDa, a planet known as 'The Heaven of the Universe' has been having a bad year.

CoCanDa agents spread across multiple planets were working day and night to locate her. Two days later and there’s no update on the situation, no demand for ransom, not even a single clue regarding the whereabouts of the missing people.
